## Boiling Frog

* [Boiling Frog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog)
* The premise is that if a frog is put suddenly into boiling water, it will jump out, but if the frog is put in tepid water which is then brought to a boil slowly, it will not perceive the danger and will be cooked to death.
* The story is often used as a metaphor for the inability or unwillingness of people to react to or be aware of sinister threats that arise gradually rather than suddenly.
* :Warning: while this premise was at one point believed to be true, modern biologists claim this premise is false and that a frog will jump out as changing locations is a natural thermoregulation strategy for frogs.
