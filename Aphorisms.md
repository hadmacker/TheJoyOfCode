## Boiling Frog

- [Boiling Frog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog)
- The premise is that if a frog is put suddenly into boiling water, it will jump out, but if the frog is put in tepid water which is then brought to a boil slowly, it will not perceive the danger and will be cooked to death.
- The story is often used as a metaphor for the inability or unwillingness of people to react to or be aware of sinister threats that arise gradually rather than suddenly.
- :warning: while this premise was at one point believed to be true, modern biologists claim this premise is false and that a frog will jump out as changing locations is a natural thermoregulation strategy for frogs.
- [Boiling Frog Syndrome](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/boiling-frog-syndrome-suyash-jaju)
  - Don't put up with the rising temperatures, _never settle_, and act sooner rather than later!

## [Jevons paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox)

> ...Jevons paradox...occurs when technological advancements make a resource more efficient to use (thereby reducing the amount needed for a single application); however, as the cost of using the resource drops...this results in overall demand increases causing total resource consumption to rise.

Said another way:

> Imagine a new, more fuel-efficient car is invented. You might think that this would lead to less fuel being used overall. However, because the car is cheaper to run, more people might buy it and drive more often, leading to an increase in total fuel consumption.

## [Law of Jante](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Jante)

> The Law of Jante (YAN-tuh) is a code of conduct originating in fiction and now used colloquially to denote a social attitude of disapproval towards expressions of individuality and personal success.

## [Mediocrity Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediocrity_principle)

> The mediocrity principle is the philosophical notion that "if an item is drawn at random from one of several sets or categories, it's more likely to come from the most numerous category than from any one of the less numerous categories".

> The idea is to assume mediocrity, rather than starting with the assumption that a phenomenon is special, privileged, exceptional, or even superior.

## Occam's Razor

[Occam's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor)

> pluralitas non est ponenda sine necessitate

or...

- “plurality should not be posited without necessity.”
- "Entities are not to be multiplied beyond necessity."
- The principle gives precedence to simplicity: **of two competing theories, the simpler explanation of an entity is to be preferred.**

## Principle of Least Astonishment (POLA)

Also known as the "Principle of Least Surprise"

- [Principle of Least Astonishment (POLA), Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment)
  > "a component of a system should behave in a way that most users will expect it to behave, and therefore not astonish or surprise users."

## [Streisand Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect)

> The Streisand effect is a phenomenon that occurs when an attempt to hide, remove, or censor information has the unintended consequence of increasing awareness of that information

## [Survivorship Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias)

- The logical error of concentrating on the things that made it past selection and overlooking those that did not, typically because of a lack of visibility.
- This can lead to incorrect conclusions regarding that which didn't make it through selection.

## [The Stormtrooper Problem](https://fs.blog/stormtrooper-problem/)

> The Stormtrooper problem is when everyone working on a problem thinks about it similarly.

This one is about diversity of thought. Selection requires variety. Are we weeding out the mix of perspectives that could give us a better solution?

## Yoda Conditions

[Yoda Conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoda_conditions) reverse the traditional order of two values in conditional checks.
